# explore-hapi
Project to learn the nodeJS 'hapi' module.

This project was created to me to learn the nodeJS 'HAPI' module.

The master branch is where I am planning to bring the project up to date using the latest version of HAPI and latest versions of the other dependencies. 

## As of 6/7/2018 no changes have been made and master branch is the same as the HAPI-v8 branch.
